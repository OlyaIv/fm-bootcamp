                <h1>A small peak into my life outside working hours</h1>
                <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm open for trying out new things in life, finding inspiration in myself and what I'm into currently.

                <p>For a very long time I was ashamed of not being super pro at one thing, and the fact that I didn't
                have one hobby to be consestent in. But I was lucky enough to realise that trying yourself in
                different things in your life is also valuable.
                </p>
                I have tried myself in makeup artistry, pole dancing, baking, high heels dancing, singing and little bit of painting. I'm not a pro but I'm having fun!
